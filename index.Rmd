  This book documents the process for creating a database from the sagebrush-obligate songbird data we collected in Box Elder and Cassia counties during the 2022 field season. It will also describe the data cleaning process and contain some initial figures and analyses.

# Summary 

To examine how sagebrush-obligate songbirds (SOBS) respond to habitat changes and recovery associated with wildfires, we collected point count data on SOBS in northwest Utah and south-central Idaho across 30 pairs of burned and control plots. Data was collected in a single data collection form using Survey123. Each plot was 1km x 1km and contained a minimum of 10 equally-spaced points that were 125m from the plot border and 250m from each other point. The data collection form was structured such that every new form constituted a new visit to a specific 1km plot. Within that form, observers added a nested point form for each point surveyed. Within each point, each observation of individual or large groups of birds was added. As such, there were three levels of data collected: each visit to each site, the points within each of those visits, and the observations at each of those points. 



## Usage 

Each **bookdown** chapter is an .Rmd file, and each .Rmd file can contain one (and only one) chapter. A chapter *must* start with a first-level heading: `# A good chapter`, and can contain one (and only one) first-level heading.

Use second-level and higher headings within chapters like: `## A short section` or `### An even shorter section`.

The `index.Rmd` file is required, and is also your first book chapter. It will be the homepage when you render the book.

## Render book

You can render the HTML version of this example book without changing anything:

1. Find the **Build** pane in the RStudio IDE, and

1. Click on **Build Book**, then select your output format, or select "All formats" if you'd like to use multiple formats from the same book source files.

Or build the book from the R console:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
bookdown::render_book()
```

To render this example to PDF as a `bookdown::pdf_book`, you'll need to install XeLaTeX. You are recommended to install TinyTeX (which includes XeLaTeX): <https://yihui.org/tinytex/>.

## Preview book

As you work, you may start a local server to live preview this HTML book. This preview will update as you edit the book when you save individual .Rmd files. You can start the server in a work session by using the RStudio add-in "Preview book", or from the R console:

```{r eval=FALSE}
bookdown::serve_book()
```


```{r include=FALSE}
# automatically create a bib database for R packages
knitr::write_bib(c(
  .packages(), 'bookdown', 'knitr', 'rmarkdown'
), 'packages.bib')
```
